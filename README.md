# learningcpp
A repo with stuff which hopefully will help you and me learn C++.

It contains an [exp](https://github.com/waifod/cppexp/tree/main/exp) folder with some tiny programs to play around with C++ features and [a list of resources](https://github.com/waifod/cppexp/tree/main/resources.md) which I found useful in my process.
